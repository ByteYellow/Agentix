"""Regression: a worker respawn must not silently drop the new stream.

The host bridges (`/trace`, `/log`) dedup by `_seq`: an inbound event with
`seq <= _last_seq` is treated as a duplicate of an already-delivered event
and dropped. When a worker subprocess crashes and is respawned, it builds a
fresh `ReliableStream` whose `_seq` counter restarts at 1 — but the host's
`_last_seq` is still high from the previous worker, so without a stream id
the new worker's first events look like duplicates and vanish.

`ReliableStream` stamps each envelope with a per-instance `_sid`; the host
resets its cursor when the id changes. These tests feed two streams (the
second restarting its `_seq`) straight through `trigger_event` and assert
the restarted stream's early events are delivered, not swallowed.
