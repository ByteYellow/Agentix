"""Deployment Protocol + plugin registry.

A deployment backend is anything that creates / deletes / inspects a
sandbox. The framework treats them as plugins: each backend is a class
registered under the `agentix.deployment` entry-point group. Backends
ship in their own packages (`agentix-deployment-docker`,
`agentix-deployment-fly`, ...).

```toml
# downstream pyproject.toml
[project.entry-points."agentix.deployment"]
fly = "agentix_deployment_fly:FlyDeployment"
```

```python
# downstream module
from agentix.deployment import Deployment   # Protocol

class FlyDeployment:                          # no inheritance, structural type
    async def create(self, cfg): ...
    async def delete(self, sid): ...
    async def get(self, sid): ...
```

`load_deployment("fly")` works after the install with zero framework
changes.
