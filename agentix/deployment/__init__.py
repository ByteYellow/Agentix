"""Deployment Protocol + backend discovery.

Core ships the `Deployment` Protocol, `Sandbox` dataclass, and backend
registry. Backend wheels (`agentix-deployment-docker`, `-daytona`,
`-e2b`, third-party) each install a sibling module under
`agentix.deployment`; extending `__path__` lets those siblings co-exist
with the framework files in this directory.
