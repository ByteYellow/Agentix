"""Runtime transport wire types.

Every type here is part of the runtime wire surface between
`RuntimeClient` (orchestrator side), the runtime server (sandbox side),
and the worker subprocess. Both client and server import from here.

Wire encoding: callable identity travels as an import path
(`module::qualname`). Args, kwargs, and return values travel as stdlib
pickle blobs so arbitrary Python values can cross the boundary.
