"""Wires `agentix.trace.emit(...)` to the Socket.IO `trace` room.

Trace events reach the runtime two ways:

  1. **In-process workers** (test fixtures) call `agentix.trace.emit` in
     the runtime's own process — the local subscriber list fires,
     including the SIO emitter we subscribe below.
  2. **Subprocess workers** (production) call `agentix.trace.emit` in
     a child process, which forwards `trace` frames over stdio. The
     multiplexer's `_trace_forwarder` callback (the same function we
     return from `install_trace_bridge`) is called for each frame and
     re-emits onto the SIO `traces` room.

Both paths converge in one function — the SIO room is the single
publication channel.
