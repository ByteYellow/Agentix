"""`agentix` command-line interface.

The core CLI intentionally stays narrow: `agentix build` packages a
project into a bundle artifact, `agentix deploy` materializes that
artifact for a deployment backend, and `agentix plugin` inspects the
installed deployment backends.

Argument parsing is delegated to click — each subcommand is a
`click.Command` registered on the `agentix` group. Click owns `--help`,
error formatting, and option validation; the CLI modules stay free of
routing boilerplate.

    `standalone_mode=False` keeps click from calling `sys.exit` itself,
    so this function composes cleanly from tests and other in-process
    callers. Two failure paths reach here:

      * Click's own usage errors (`UsageError`, including missing
        arguments and `BadParameter`) — we render them to stderr and
        raise `SystemExit(2)`.
      * Command bodies that signal failure with `raise SystemExit(...)`
        — they propagate through untouched.

    Both cases land at Python's default `SystemExit` handling in the
    console-script wrapper, which yields the right process exit code.
