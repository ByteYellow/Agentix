# Agentix

**Sandboxed rollouts you call like typed Python.**

Turn agents, tools, and scorers into Python callables. Package their
dependencies into bundle images. Call them from evaluators, trainers,
and orchestration code without writing a new runner for every pairing.

## The 10-Second Model

Agentix has two primitives:

- **Remote calls**: `client.remote(fn, *args, **kwargs)` runs a Python
  callable inside a sandbox worker. The callable is encoded as an
  import-path `RemoteCallable`; args, kwargs, and return values travel
  as pickle blobs.
- **Bundles**: `agentix build [path]` packages a Python project and its
  declared dependencies into a deploy-ready bundle image.

```python
from agentix import RuntimeClient, SandboxConfig, session
from agentix.bash import run
from agentix.deployment.docker import DockerDeployment

config = SandboxConfig(
    image="python:3.13-slim",
    bundle="hello-agentix:0.1.0",
)
async with session(DockerDeployment(), config) as sandbox:
    async with RuntimeClient(sandbox.runtime_url) as client:
        result = await client.remote(run, command="echo hello from $(uname -a)")
```

The unit of composition is not a bespoke benchmark runner or agent
adapter. It is a Python callable.

## Why Agentix Exists

Agent experiments sprawl quickly. One agent needs a CLI wrapper. Another
needs a Python harness. A benchmark needs repo setup, grading scripts,
and logs. A training loop needs the same pieces batched across many
sandboxes.

Agentix collapses that matrix into one execution contract: if Python can
serialize the callable and the sandbox has its dependencies, the host can
call it.

| You have | You expose | You call |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Claude Code, Codex, Aider, OpenHands, or an internal agent | `async def run(...) -> RunResult` | `await client.remote(run, ...)` |
| Shell, files, repo setup, or local tools | `async def run(command: str) -> BashResult` | `await client.remote(bash_run, ...)` |
| SWE-bench, MLE-Bench, or an internal evaluator | `async def score(...) -> Score` | `await client.remote(score, ...)` |

## What Ships

- **Remote calls** (`await client.remote(fn, *args, **kwargs)`) across
  the host-to-sandbox boundary. The host encodes `fn` as a
  `RemoteCallable` import path; args, kwargs, and the return value
  travel as pickle blobs.
- **One runtime worker process today** behind an internal worker backend
  boundary, so future pools or per-call isolation can stay API-compatible.
- **Tracing** as an orthogonal layer: `agentix.trace.span(...)` inside
  the sandbox produces Trace/Span/SpanEvent lifecycle events that
  cross to the host via a side-channel and dispatch to any
  `agentix.trace.Processor` the host has registered.
- **Bundle builds** from normal Python projects and `pyproject.toml`
  dependencies.
- **Optional Nix system dependencies** when a project includes
  `default.nix`.
- **Deployment backend plugins** through the `agentix.deployment` entry
  point group.

## Quickstart

Run the smallest demo from
[`agentix-cookbook/examples/hello-agentix`](https://github.com/Agentiix/agentix-cookbook/tree/main/examples/hello-agentix):

```bash
cd examples/hello-agentix
uv sync
uv run agentix build . --name hello-agentix  # builds hello-agentix:0.1.0
uv run python run.py
```

When the sandbox runs on a different CPU architecture than your build
host, build for the sandbox platform explicitly, for example
`uv run agentix build . --name hello-agentix --platform linux/amd64`.

The demo builds `hello-agentix:0.1.0`, overlays it onto
`python:3.13-slim`, then calls `agentix.bash.run` inside the sandbox:

```python
import asyncio

from agentix import RuntimeClient, SandboxConfig, session
from agentix.bash import run
from agentix.deployment.docker import DockerDeployment


async def main() -> None:
    deployment = DockerDeployment()
    config = SandboxConfig(
        image="python:3.13-slim",
        bundle="hello-agentix:0.1.0",
    )
    async with session(deployment, config) as sandbox:
        print(f"sandbox up at {sandbox.runtime_url}")
        async with RuntimeClient(sandbox.runtime_url) as client:
            result = await client.remote(run, command="echo hello from $(uname -a)")
            print(f"exit={result.exit_code} stdout={result.stdout!r}")


asyncio.run(main())
```

## Architecture

```text
Host process
  RuntimeClient.remote(fn, *args, **kwargs)
    builds RemoteCallable from fn's import path
    pickles (args, kwargs) as one blob
        |
        v  Socket.IO `/` (call / call:result / call:error / cancel)
Sandbox
  agentix-server
        |  msgpack frame
        v
  worker subprocess
    RemoteCallable.resolve() imports fn
    pickle.loads(arguments) -> args, kwargs
    calls fn(*args, **kwargs)
    pickles the result back
```

`c.remote()` rides Socket.IO `/`; cancellation has its own event
(`cancel`). Trace, log, and plugin traffic use dedicated SIO namespaces
on the same connection (`/trace`, `/log`, `/<plugin>`). HTTP is kept
only for `/health`. Errors stay in-band.
